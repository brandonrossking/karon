Much like Charon, `convey` transports information across the chasm
that divides tabular data structures, like Excel and SQL, and hierarchical
data structures, such as JSON, XML, and MongoDB.


Description
===========

Tabular data structures provide an intuitive and efficient way to input
data. However, these lack the flexibility to adapt to the new connections
that inevitably occur during research, development, and exploration.
Hierarchical data structures adapt well, but the task of explicitly
linking each data point to all associated nodes is onerous and impractical
for data entry.

`convey` transforms user data recorded in tabular forms into hierarchical
data. This facilitates the discovery of new data connections, eliminates
the need for the user to become intimately familiar with the data schema,
allows data entry in the orderly format that tabulated data structures
provide, and critically, allow information to be passed up-and-down the
data chain: from parent to child (in a process called *inheritance*) and
from children back to parent (in a process called *reduction*).
