Version 0.1
===========

- Added an Excel reader based on `pandas.read_excel` that will parse
  lists, tuples, and other basic python types from string cells.
- Created basic structures (node objects, inorder, preorder, postorder,
  and breadth-first trees) for constructing tree structures.
- Extended basic node functionality to operational nodes, that add
  logic-based operational control, e.g. read-write, read-only, write-only,
  etc.
- Developed a decorator-based framework for constructing specific node
  types.
